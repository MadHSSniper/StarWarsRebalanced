victory_mkii,SHIP,"An improved version of the Victory I-class Star Destroyer. The Victory II-class was a more direct predecessor to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Though outwardly similar to the Victory I-class Star Destroyer, the Victory II-class was designed for deep space combat.",,,
mki_sd,SHIP,"Imperial-class Star Destroyers had a distinguished career in the Imperial Starfleet, where they symbolized the Empire's military might. Eventually, these Star Destroyers rendered older vessels, like the Venator-class, obsolete. Capable of laying waste to entire worlds ,the Imperial-class became infamous as the prime enforcer of Imperial rule, and even served as a small, peacekeeping battleship.",,,
mkii_sd,SHIP,"The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Imperial II-class Destroyer and colloquially the "ImpStar Deuce", was a Star Destroyer model that was derived from the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer.",,,
mc80_homeone,SHIP,"The MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser was one of the several MC80 Star Cruiser designs built by the Mon Calamari. Originally fielded before the Galactic Civil War as civilian vessels, they were modified by the Rebel Alliance, and served in command ship and battleship roles in the Alliance Fleet. Although the most common MC80 subclass was the MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser, the Home One type was perhaps the most famous of all Rebel capital ship designs, as it was the class of the Home One and the Independence, which served as Admiral Ackbar's flagships in many famous battles.",,,
liberty_mc80,SHIP,"The MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser was an early type of Mon Calamari Star Cruiser put into service for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Mon Calamari designs, each vessel was individually unique, which was frustrating for Rebel technicians. As with other Calamari designs during the Galactic Civil War, all warships in this group were standardized as much as possible to aid non-Calamari crewmembers.",,,
mc40_a,SHIP,"The MC40 was a small Rebel capital ship, larger than the Imperial Strike-class medium cruiser. It was equipped with powerful shields for a vessel of its size. Its three engines gave it a higher speed than the bigger MC80a Star Cruiser, and it was more maneuverable.",,,
mc30_c,SHIP,"It was considered one of the most powerful mid-level ships used in the war. MC30c frigates utilized proton torpedoes to bombard larger enemy starships in combat. In addition to this, it was also one of the fastest ships of its type. It featured several proton torpedo launchers as well as turbolaser batteries. The largest weakness of the ship was that it had very light armor. The weapons it carried were strong enough to threaten most capital ships, but if heavy fire was concentrated on the frigate, it would most likely be destroyed.",,,
nebulon_b,SHIP,"The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate was a 300-meter-long warship that was built for use by the Imperial Navy, to protect convoys from Rebel Alliance starfighter actions. It was, however, used more famously by the Rebellion. While generally well-armed for a vessel of that size, its midsection connecting spar was a vulnerability. It could be split open by concentrated heavy weapons fire, venting the frigate's atmosphere and killing most of the crew.",,,
yt_1300,SHIP,"The appeal of the YT-1300 transport was not its basic equipment, but in its ability to take an extraordinary amount of modifications and alterations. In short, the YT-1300 was reliable, durable, and easy to modify, hence its popularity amongst freighter captains throughout the galaxy.",,,
cr90_corvette,SHIP,"The CR90 corvette, commonly referred to as the Corellian corvette or the Rebel blockade runner, was a small, multi-purpose capital ship.

tie_bomber,SHIP,"The TIE/sa bomber, simply known as the TIE bomber, was a larger, less maneuverable TIE starfighter used for destroying large starships and pinpoint-precision bombing. The "sa" in the TIE bomber's designation stood for "surface assault." Due to their distinctive dual-hull shape, TIE bombers came to be referred to occasionally as "dupes" by enemy pilots.",,,
tie_ln,SHIP,"The TIE/LN starfighter, or TIE/line starfighter, simply known as the TIE Fighter, was the standard Imperial starfighter seen in massive numbers throughout most of the Galactic Civil War and onward. Colloquially, Rebel and New Republic pilots referred to the crafts as "eyeballs."",,,
tie_interceptor,SHIP,"The TIE/IN starfighter, or TIE Interceptor, was a TIE series starfighter used by the Galactic Empire. The TIE Interceptor was identifiable by its arrow-shaped solar collection panels, a distinct difference from the hexagonal solar arrays of its predecessor, the TIE Fighter. The Interceptor was one of the fastest starfighters in the galaxy at its prime, nearly rivaling the Alliance's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. Due to their speed, distinct shape, and narrow profile in comparison to the TIE/ln starfighter (which was nicknamed "eyeball"), TIE Interceptors came to be referred to occasionally as "squints" by enemy pilots.",,,
y_wing_btl,SHIP,"Affectionately known as a "wishbone" to Rebel Alliance and New Republic pilots, the Y-wing starfighter was deployed as a fighter-bomber, designed to fight its way to its objective, deliver its payload of high explosives, and fight its way out again. Its weaponry included two laser cannons, two ion cannons, and two proton torpedo launchers.",,,
b_wing_heavy,SHIP,"The B-wing starfighter was one of the largest and most heavily armed starfighters/bombers in the Rebel Alliance's fleet. The name B-wing came from the craft's remote similarity in appearance to the lowercase letter "b", although its swordlike shape in attack mode has earned it the nickname "blade-wing", which may be another reason for the "b" prefix.",,,
a_wing_rz1,SHIP,"The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor was a cockpit attached to twin engines. The A-wing required pilots of exceptional skill to take full advantage of the vessel's speed, agility, and special features. One of the fastest mass-produced interceptors in the known galaxy, the A-wing was even faster than the Imperial's TIE Interceptor.",,,
x_wing_t65,SHIP,"The Incom T-65 X-wing starfighter was the primary all-purpose starfighter of the Rebel Alliance and its successor governments. Known for its versatility and exceptional combat performance, it was a favorite with Rebel and New Republic pilots. Possessing deflector shields, a hyperdrive, an R2 astromech for repairs and navigation, and a complement of proton torpedoes, the X-wing allowed the Rebellion to launch raids in Imperial space with improved odds of a successful mission.",,,
