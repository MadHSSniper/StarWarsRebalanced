Due to ease of manufacture, hundreds of models exist in the Sector. Any weapon that fires inert projectiles with calibers under 12.7x50mm at over 1200 rounds per minute can be called a light machine gun, but beyond that the mechanisms that drive the actions of these weapons vary considerably. ,,,

A Cluster Bomb projector is equipped with three tubes designed to fire dozens of Mark II Explosively Formed Penetrator bomblets. The bomblets are unguided and have no propulsion system, relying on the inital momentum of the strike craft. They are equipped with a friend-or-foe targeting scanner, and will only detonate when impacting an appropriate target. The shaped charge explosive is very effective versus unshielded targets. The sheer number of bomblets that can be deployed by this weapon system is staggering, and as such it makes the Cluster Bomb a useful area denial weapon.",Strike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,
A Light Needler is a 15mm flechette gun, designed to fire caseless ammunition. Features an impressive feed system which can deliver hundreds of ""needles"" per second. There is no need for an ejector system, and the resulting space availability is instead used to provide additional cooling units, vastly improving the rate of fire. ,,

flak,WEAPON,"A defensive weapon system that fires shrapnel-filled shells equipped with a proximity fuse for maximum effect against fighters and missiles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The rising prominence of small, cheap fighter craft, especially in the strike role has led to a wider deployment of this weapons system. A 40 mm barrel fires rounds fitted with a proximity fuse. The resulting explosion sends a hail of flechettes in a wide area, with a kill radius of 45 meters. Newer models feature a fire control system hardwired into a Mark VI Predictor.",Point Defense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heavymg,WEAPON,"A larger cousin of the ubiquitous rapid-fire machine gun line of weapons, the Heavy MG is effective against both small and medium-sized targets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
A workhorse of patrol craft across the sector, this weapons system features a reliable, centuries-old blowback firing mechanism. Safety features include a positive cook-off safety for open bolt clearing and double ram prevention. The weapon is typically mounted on a relatively heavy base to help absorb recoil during prolonged bursts of fire.  Calibers vary, but are usually in the 17-20mm range. ,,
,,,,,
The heavier projectiles do not shatter upon impact like lighter ammunition and present a credible threat to frigate-class vessels. Extremely accurate, though slower-firing than a vulcan cannon.  Excels in a point-defense role.",Point Defense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arbalest,WEAPON,"An antiquated weapon design with high per-shot damage for its size. The kinetic shells are especially effective versus enemy shields.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Heavier patrol craft at the time of the Collapse were mostly fitted with the Arbalest Mk I weapons platform. This is probably the reason the Arbalest is claimed to be the most scavenged ship weapon system in the Sector post-Collapse. The primitive cooling system and a lack of an autoejector hamper rate of fire and reliability. ,,,,,
,,,,,
The only redeeming feature is the ubiquity of the 42mm arbalest round, which is effective at bringing down enemy shields. The effectiveness of the shells is poorly understood, and is suspected to lie in the electromagnetic properties of the shell jackets.",Close Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dualflak,WEAPON,"An upgraded, viciously effective dual mount of the Flak Cannon. Nicknamed ""The Widowmaker"" for its ability to tear apart incoming fighters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just like the standard flak cannon, this weapon devastates smaller fighter and missile targets, firing two 40mm proximity fuse fitted rounds. Shaped dispersal ensures dual detonation and a higher kill radius of up to 60 meters. Fighter craft are rarely launched against ships that are fitted with this weapon system, out of fear of what it can do. Excellent rate of fire and turret turn rate.",Point Defense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,
The only drawback is a heavier turret profile which, coupled with the lack of the accompanying governor blueprint, is typically mounted on incompatible rotators giving rise to unexpectedly low turret rotation speeds.",Assault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heavymauler,WEAPON,"An advanced weapon system designed to punch through armor plating at long-range. Has a low rate of fire and high per-shot damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
A brutal weapon, the heavy mauler is designed to engage targets at medium to long-range. At its core, the weapon is a 140mm autocannon with a nano-cooling system and an external ejection port. However, unlike normal autocannons, maulers are distinguished by barrel modifications which give their shells special properties. In the case of the Heavy Mauler, the modification is an antimatter charger.
,,,,,
When leaving the firing chamber, each shell ogive is charged with a field of anti-protons which hovers 10-20 nanometers in front of the shell, stabilized by a baryon coating. On impact with a target, this anti-proton ""sheath"" loses structural integrity and the resulting reaction does further damage. Given the fact that 140mm shells already deliver an impressive amount of destructive force to the target, the combined reaction makes the Heavy Mauler particularly effective versus armored targets.",Close Support,,,,,,,,,,
heavyac,WEAPON,"A triple-barreled cannon that fires a burst of standardized shells at medium range. Due to the inert shell, it is most effective versus enemy shields.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Medium caliber, triple-barreled autocannon, typically deployed with 30mm ammunition. Electrically primed firing fuses ensure precise fire counts. A great fire support weapon, it is typically fitted on destroyer and cruiser class ships. A battery of heavy autocannons with a proper firing solution may pose a serious threat to capital ships. ,,

The hypervelocity driver uses a 2-stage process to accelerate a 55mm duranium slug with a magnetized iron-cobalt core to a very high velocity.  A chemical charge accelerates the slug first, and then the magnetic coils take over, accelerating the slug further and stabilizing its trajectory.  The slug is highly charged by the time it reaches the target, generating a significant amount of electromagnetic interference on the ship it impacts.",Close Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A truly devastating weapon platform, named for the archaic god of volcanoes. A typical turret mount features two 120mm L/89 barrels that take turns firing armor destroying rounds at 240 rounds a minute. An electro-magnetic ejector, powered feed system and nanocoolants allow the weapon to fire for extended time periods. The shaped charge shells have low muzzle velocity and great armor penetrating power. ",Assault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mark9,WEAPON,"An imposing medium range autocannon, most effective versus shields. Also obliterates unarmored hulls with a large volume of heavy caliber projectiles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
It is known that early epoch spaceships lacked armor protection. A weapon with a name like the Mark IX Autocannon was probably a refinement of the earliest schools of weapons engineering in the Domain. Two 120mm barrels, combined with a unique double-loader system form the simple core of the weapon.,,,,
,,,,,
The first Mark IX blueprint was recovered from the techmines on Exar Secundus, and the weapon was hastily declared obsolete. The blueprint was auctioned off to a small mercenary organization known as the Free Star Combine and forgotten. ,,,,
,,,,,
Cycles later, the Free Star Combine finally built a prototype and begun weapon trials. The weapon was deemed too huge, difficult to mount in all but the largest craft, mediocre at best versus armored targets, and its range was anything but extraordinary. Nonetheless, the Mark IX stubbornly refused to be explained away by the theorists, as its raw damage output is impressive. These naysayers were quieted even further when secondary trials showed how utterly devastating the Mark IX is to shield generators.
,,,,,
The results of these trials did not remain secret for long, and the availability of the now common blueprints meant that the Mark IX was quickly manufactured to meet the demand in the Sector.,,,,

A very advanced design, the Mjolnir is technically a magneto-gravitic shell projector, not a standard cannon. The micro capacitors within each shell are able to deliver enough energy to create a localized singularity with a Schwarzschild radius of 1.8 millimeters. The built-in gravitic lens devastates all nearby matter, and creates the dreaded electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effect, disabling the target's weapons and systems. ",Assault,,,,,,,,,,
multineedler,WEAPON,"Fires multitudes of needles in a tight arc, creating a withering hail of projectiles that rip apart anything in their path. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Storm Needler is a flechette weapon, which fires caseless 15mm ammunition. Having reached the practical limits of medium sized cooling systems, the designers of caseless weapons blazed a path into the large weapon category with the Storm Needler's advanced nano coolant recyclers, per-barrel magnetized rifling and automated operation. An AI core-controlled autoloader unpacks and loads just the right amounts of ammunition from the magazines, allowing for almost nonstop operation.,

This weapon is, at base, simply a laser beam with a tripled sapphire gain medium to ensure the highest possible weaponized wavelengths. The photons are fired through a hyperdimensional filter which outputs an energy beam that exists partially in p-space. The physics of the filter are not properly understood, and in laboratory settings the p-space components of a beam exceeding 6.66 giga-watts will sometimes flicker - as if blocked.

The physics that create the burst effect are not understood by the highest echelons of the Hegemony Science Council or even the Tri-Tachyon Science Corps. It is theorized that a q-switched multi-phased beam could be shot through a quantum filter which would ensure entanglement and create a burst effect.

plasma,WEAPON,"Usually found mounted on large capital ships. Produces a ruinous amount of damage that cannot be withstood by ships' defenses for long.

A Plasma Cannon is a large, arcane weapon which is difficult to manufacture and maintain. Those captains who can afford to do so are rewarded with one of the most devastating weapons platforms employed in the Sector.

Plasma Cannons are related to Graviton and Phase Beams, in that they use the properties of brane physics to deliver their payloads. A plasma cannon shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward. The resulting explosion creates plasma which is contained by a temporary mini-universe anomaly, while magnetic drivers mounted on the forward pylons accelerate it toward the target. The containment field lasts only a couple of seconds, which is usually enough for the anomaly to reach a target. If the convex hull of the field is not breached by ordinary matter/energy delivering least 9 kN, the higher brane will absorb the destructive plasma, and it will vanish from our dimension forever. ",Assault,,
hil,WEAPON,"An extremely long-range, high damage energy beam cannon, often mounted on support cruisers with great effect.

The High Intensity Laser is a powerhouse weapon that has an energy rating well beyond the giga-watt range. To produce such power for an extended period of time, the design relies on a built-in fusion power core. This core still requires an external actuator, a role filled by a ship's reactor when firing commences. 

Three meticulously calibrated lens assemblies guide photons within the ignition unit, requiring seconds to build up the energy necessary to maintain a coherent beam. The gain medium is a two-staged gas-solid which is q-switched and provides a potent particle stream that can obliterate unsuspecting targets in seconds.

The extreme range at which targets can be tracked and destroyed makes the HIL excel in safely providing close support to friendly ships that are engaged in a melee. It is a favored weapon of captains that can manage the flux cost associated with operating it.",Close Support,,

The Guardian is a military grade PD system that is usually only deployed on capital ships due to its high production and flux costs. Can detect and destroy incoming strike weapons and enemy fighters that have penetrated the capital ship's defensive escort screen. 

A combination of an autonomous AI core for targeting and five separate carbon dioxide lasers make this weapon exceptionally effective in point defense. A dedicated rotator power supply makes target tracking almost instantaneous. The prohibitive energy requirement usually means that the weapon is only activated for seconds at a time, but that is usually enough to deal with any PD threat.",Point Defense,,
tpc,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from the early epoch, the TPC is built directly into the Onslaught's hull and provides overwhelming frontal firepower.

Designed before modular energy weapons were a reality, this weapon was coded into the Onslaught's blueprint because no other ship was large enough or had reactors capable of generating the requisite power.

Even though it's outperformed by some of the later epoch modular designs, the Thermal Pulse Cannon remains an integral part of the Onslaught's arsenal.",Assault,,
tachyonlance,WEAPON,"Uncanny range and damage capability make this burst operated beam deliver a devastating amount cascading EMP damage to targets at extreme ranges.

A weapon so rare and powerful that it has achieved mythical status in the Sector, the Tachyon Lance uses the same core technology as all FTL communication systems, but with a twist. Instead of using the hyperdimensional properties of the tachyon particle for communication, n-brane manipulation and anti-plasma generators create a charged tachyon stream that travels in hyperspace. Minimum energy requirements are set at 35 terawatts. This amount of power can only be generated for a few seconds by the largest power capacitors, which are housed within the weapon system. 

Unlike the beams fired from normal beam weapons, the tachyon stream is not lensed or altered in any way - in fact once the initial tachyon marker is actuated the reaction takes on a life of its own, rapidly consuming the power stored in the capacitors and unleashing destruction. When normal space is exposed to such high levels of anti-plasma, a combined electro-magnetic, gravitic and thermal cavitation effect shreds anything that stands in its way, while also severely damaging nearby electronics equipment.

Normal tachyon streams used for communication have infinite range. It is not entirely clear why this weapon has limited range, and it is suspected that it is a limit somehow hardcoded into the baryonic emitter assembly by thoughtful and practical Domain weapon designers.

After all, if the weapon had infinite range, how would you know you are not hitting an unintended target thousands of light years away?",Fire Support,,
onslaught,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain of Man eons ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, fighter craft, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war, in which the Domain was triumphant. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgrade the FTL drives and reduce the necessary crew complement. Even with other battleship blueprints available to the Sector, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and men. And strike back it can. The Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

Building an Onslaught-class hull and preparing it for combat is thought to be economically impossible for all but the Hegemony. The Onslaught-class proudly serves as the backbone of the Hegemony Defense Fleet.",,,
astral,SHIP,"A technologically advanced capital ship designed primarily as a carrier, the Astral-class is able to project vast amounts of firepower through its numerous fighter craft squadrons.

The Astral-class ships are thought to have been the epitome of carrier design in the Domain during the years prior to the Collapse. Nearly all systems that can be automated are, with each handled by sophisticated AI cores installed throughout the ship. Defensive weapon systems are typically, but not always, point defense turrets and long-range missiles. 

The true power of an Astral lies in its fighter craft, which give the carrier unprecedented flexibility in the battle space. Nearly any enemy ship type that appears on the captain's scopes can quickly be dispatched, given just a launch order of a wing of nimble interceptors, strike bombers or fighters. Automated facilities ensure that a squadron coming back from a mission can quickly be repaired and rearmed behind the safety of the powerful X-35 shield emitter. The Astral-class is very vulnerable should the X-35 come down. This is why when not protected by its fighter wings it never travels alone, but instead is at the head of space-borne carrier fleets. These task forces are a rarity, as the power they hold is usually required to subjugate entire planets or blockade enormous areas of space.

The Astral is perhaps the most technologically advanced capital ship that can be seen in the Sector today. Few serve with the Hegemony due to the high technological requirements that it imposes on orbital docks. Senior Naval Corporate Officers of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation or extremely wealthy private admirals sometimes make an Astral their flagship.",,,
atlas,SHIP,"The Atlas-class ships are large space-borne cargo platforms with FTL drive and a few defensive systems. Hundreds of containers can be latched on to the hull and carried with ease by this behemoth. 

Typically used to efficiently resupply entire outposts, the Atlas is ill suited to the small and fast trade runs that are the mainstay of commerce in the sector. Their slow speed and large size always tempt uninvited guests, ranging from curious gawkers come to see the hulking colossus, to scavenging pirates aiming to disable a container's magneto-gravitic fastener, to Cult madmen bent on destroying it all. Nonetheless, the Hegemony makes wide use of them, especially to offload biomass from farming worlds on a seasonal basis. For the purpose, the Hegemony assembles large Atlas convoys; these are protected by military cruisers that ensure that the lifeline of Hegemony citizens is kept safe.

The captaincy of an Atlas is a rare punishment for the able, an uneven mixture of soul-numbing boredom and abject terror, being the results of normal trade runs and pirate attacks, respectively.",,,
conquest,SHIP,"The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. ,,

dominator,SHIP,"Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending stationary installations and vital system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

One can only wonder what the Domain Navy could accomplish with a fleet of these sleek, asymmetric, and eminently effective vessels. The shields are backed up by hyper-advanced flux dissipation system, installed throughout the hull, which gives the Aurora a very deep flux pool. This makes maintaining crew morale an easy task for captains. ,

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
medusa,SHIP,"A small yet fearsome ship, whose top tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with Black Ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.,,,,,
,,,,,
Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a Black Ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.,,
,,,,,
Sector naval tacticians have few answers for the threat that the Medusa presents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mule,SHIP,"The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Often its captains casually ferry cargo to and fro between the star systems of the Sector alone and comfortable in the knowledge that they could afford the best protection a freighter captain can hope to get, short of an escort, of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buffalo2,SHIP,"A derived class, based on the Buffalo freighter. The modifications include the addition of military grade power generators, heavier armor, and maneuvering thrusters as well as the removal of the Mk. I shield emitter.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The Sector is violent and unpredictable, and conflicts often flare up over the smallest resource or perceived slight. In such situations military-grade ships are sometimes not available quickly enough. Thus, resourceful engineers turn to hull modifications in order to be able to meet the demand for war materiel.,,,
,,,,,
The base hull of this destroyer is a standard Buffalo-class freighter, however due to the scope of the hull conversion, the Buffalo Mk. II is considered a separate class. The result is a fighting ship which can hold its own and fight back hard, especially if properly screened from strikes and heavier hulls. The unorthodox weapons configuration often leads to unique fleet formations, and hull modifications often mean that no two Buffalo Mk. IIs are quite the same.,
,,,,,
The tactics employed by a Buffalo Mk. II captain will vary as much as his hull configuration, but rarely involve standing toe-to-toe with anything heavier than a frigate due to the lack of a shield generator and energy weapon emplacements. The combat plans usually involve a one hit wonder strategem that never works on the same enemy twice, which is perfectly fine with the crew of the Buffalo Mk. II.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
valkyrie,SHIP,"The Valkyrie-class ship a standard destroyer-sized troop transport with enough room to carry two companies of marines. Tactically it is weak for its size, only able to defend itself at short ranges from missiles and fighters.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
 As an atmosphere-capable ship, the Valkyrie is now often used to deploy heavy infantry support for tech raids on decivilized worlds. ,,,,
,,,,,
The ability to deliver large amounts of troops directly to ground targets prompted Hegemony bureaucrats to designate the hull as ""restricted"" for sale to third parties. Naturally, news of the restriction made it to the general public cycles before it came into effect, launching ill-fated speculation in the future prices of this class. Thus, overproduction and the hull's limited options made the speculator's activities bets largely moot, the only net result is that now, due to oversupply, it is just as easy to obtain a Valkyrie ship as before news of the Hegemony ban ever became public.",,,
tarsus,SHIP,"Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most well put together and durable freighters in the Sector. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers to be hazard duty ships, presumably built to be able to supply front line fleets in titanic conflicts which engulfed the stars of the Domain of Man.,,,,
,,,,,
Unmatched among non-combat ships in their bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class ships are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, which is a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.,,,
,,,,,
Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain. Rarer still are the Condor-class conversion, which completely disassemble the Tarsus right cargo pylon to create a completely new class of ship and present a tactical surprise to the unwary.",,,,,,,,,,,
gemini,SHIP,"A common freighter, found in convoys or alone, used to haul all manner of goods across the Sector. Has a small flight deck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The design of the Gemini-class freighter is highly modular, enabling the ship to serve in a variety of roles in and out of combat. The entire cargo container is designed around a quick release mechanism which enables the main hull of the ship to quickly hyperspace in, detach its full cargo section, and swap it for another Gemini-type container in the span of minutes. In addition, multiple medium weapon mounts make the Gemini a viable long-range fire support platform. The flight deck is tiny, and was probably envisioned for mining drone repair om hazardous mining operations. Modern use in the Sector extends flight deck facilities to all fighter types.
,,,,,
While impressive in a blueprint, the lack of empty, compatible Gemini-type containers in the Sector makes the actual usefulness of the quick-release mechanism negligible. The modularity, a great boon in times past is also more prone to wear and tear, and is thus more expensive to maintain. Nonetheless, a decent overall profile, the flight deck, a flexible power core and good shields make the Gemini a good choice for cargo hauling, if the cost can be weathered.",,,
buffalo,SHIP,"The go-to choice for medium cargo hauling in the Sector, the Buffalo-class freighter exemplifies the ""Load-n-Pray"" principle prevalent in Sector shipping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Sporting just a single small weapon emplacement, the hull of the ship is no more than a large engine with a tiny crew quarters section and cargo grapplers. A captain taking this ship out without a convoy rarely gets to make the same mistake twice. Incapable of anything resembling a combat maneuver, the lateral thrusters on Buffalo-class ships are designed to merely enable it to dock when (and if) it reaches its destination.,,,
,,,,,
The ship engines are the greatest contributor to hull cost, which, while low, is still within the norms for a medium freighter. The greatest contributing factor to its ubiquity is the fact that the blueprint for this ship is usually hardcoded into every orbital shipyard's blueprint database.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enforcer,SHIP,"The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to the ones found in the design of Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar epoch of the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.,,
,,,,,
Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
condor,SHIP,"All Condor-class light carriers started their service lives as Tarsus-class freighters. The conversion process is an involved and complex affair and requires proper space dock facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Some in the sector argue even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on conversions of this type to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce evidence one way or the other. Such details were all lost in the Collapse.,,
,,,,,
Nowadays the Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as the conversion is, for many, the easiest way to procure carrier capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable(for a light carrier) weapons package.",,,
sunder,SHIP,"A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer, probably designed during the Expansion Epoch. Has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons for its class. Vulnerable to strike craft.",,,
hammerhead,SHIP,"A Core Epoch midline destroyer, respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,
phaeton,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered punitive - there's little opportunity for distinction, and less chance of survival should direct contact with the enemy occur.",,,
dram,SHIP,A light tanker with enough fuel capacity to more than double the effective range of a small task force or convoy.,,,
vigilance,SHIP,"An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class can use its speed and over sized (for its class) energy and missile weapons as an advantage versus all types of foe.",,,
brawler,SHIP,"Typically deployed by system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate trades mobility for impressive firepower and weapon flexibility.",,,
tempest,SHIP,"An asymmetric, advanced design from the late Expansion Epoch, the Tempest-class is the quintessential attack frigate - fast, deadly and difficult to destroy.",,,
omen,SHIP,The Omen is rarely deployed due to the cost associated with maintaining such a technologically advanced ship. Its excellent shields and the EMP Emitter it carries make it a perfect escort for larger ships.,,,
lasher,SHIP,"A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the ubiquity of the blueprints and its non-demanding support profile, Lasher-class frigates pack a respectable amount of ballistic firepower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Lasher captains are usually no-nonsense types who let their weapons do the talking, and pick through the debris of enemy ships as opposed to trying more diplomatic or covert means of getting the job done. More often than not, that job involves quickly and effectively striking at (or guarding) small or medium-sized trade convoys. The light fighter and frigate escorts usually found guarding such convoys are hardly a match for the hail of projectiles a Lasher can quickly unleash. If that does not get the job done, the Lasher has another nasty surprise in wait - two missile hardpoints, more often than not fitted with ""finisher"" types of missile, such as the Harpoon MRM.",,,
shuttle,SHIP,"One of the smallest ships in the sector equipped with an on-board hyperdrive actuator, this class is typically used for safely transporting VIPs or couriers between star systems. Cheapest to buy of all star faring ships.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Although small, the Shuttle-class is outfitted for the comfort and security of its potential VIP passengers. It is rare to see one in combat; if a captain is unlucky enough to be in such a spot, one can quickly see why: most power systems on board are reserved for use by the life support, comfort and entertainment modules, installed to make sure that passengers do not get bored on long voyages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperion,SHIP,"A supremely advanced design, fragile but with a superb power generator and the ability to mount more ordnance than any other mainstream frigate. Extremely expensive for its size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,
Due to the perfectly modular design of the hull, power couplings and weapon slots, modifications of this ship class are not taxing on in flux shunts, plasma relays or the power core. In short, hull modifications are extremely easy to complete. It is often the case that a Hyperion-class is finely tuned with a cornucopia of mutually boosting hull modifications that make it even deadlier that a variant that is simply bristling with weapons. Naturally, such special modifications are not for the engineering novice and the uninitiated may just blow their entire fortune on a concept that seems good on paper, but is in fact useless in the battlespace. That is why there are many engineers that shun this modification-heavy approach and opt for a more weapon focused platform.
,,,,,
The end results of either approach usually affirm the apprehensive attitude Sector stellators have toward this ship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
